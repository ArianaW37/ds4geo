# Course Attendance and Requirements
Classes will take place:
* on Wednesday afternoons at 15:30 until ca. 17:45
* between 07/10/2020 and 9/12/2020 inclusive (10 sessions)
* in the Geology Institute Schausammlung

The course will be taught interactively, so a laptop with an up-to-date web-browser and an internet connection (e.g. to the university wifi) **must** be brought to each lecture.

A Google account is required for the in-class excercises and homework assignments. If you do not have one, and are not able/willing to get one, please contact the course instructor (X(at).uibk.ac.at) as early as possible.

Due to the structure of the classes (see below), attendance is requried for the full 2:15 hour period.

# Course Assessment
All assessment is based on coursework comprising two components:
* Homework assignments in weeks 1,2,3,4 and 5 comprising 5 of the total grade each, together comprising 25% of the total.
 * These assignments are required for class discussions and continuing the in-class work, so are due before the following session (i.e. 23:59 on the Tuesday before each class).
* A larger project assigned mid-way through the course and due in X, comprising 75% of the total
* All assignments except the first one are to be submitted as Jupyter Notebooks
* **Submitted how? OLAT?**

# Out-of-class work expectations
The homework assignments are expected to take 1-2 hours in the weeks they are assigned.

Furthermore, at least 1 hour a week of independent work (reading, self-set assignments, etc.) - see https://github.com/ds4geo/ds4geo/blob/master/Recommended%20Reading. While the course is designed for students without programming experience, additional python programming practice between classes is **highly** recommended. 

# Class structure and what to expect
The classes will be taught as a series of short lectures to introduce topics, followed by interactive workshops where concepts will immediately be applied and practiced via coding in python. The course notes are Jupyter Notebooks (**example**) which combine typical course notes as text and images, along with interactive python code which can be read, expanded upon, written and run within the notebook.
The course is a 2 hour VU, but will be taught as longer 2:15 sessions for only the first 10 weeks of semester. This gives students additional time to complete the main project.
