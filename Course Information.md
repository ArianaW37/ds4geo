# Course Attendance
Classes will take place:
* on Wednesday afternoons at 15:30 until ca. 17:45
* between 07/10/2020 and 9/12/2020 inclusive
* in the Geology Institute Schausammlung
The course will be taught interactively, so a laptop with an up-to-date web-browser and an internet connection (e.g. to the university wifi) **must** be brought to each lecture.
Due to the structure of the classes (see below), attendance is requried for the full 2:15 hour period.

# Course Assessment
All assessment is based on coursework comprising two components:
* Homework assignments in weeks 1,X,X,X comprising 5-15 % of the total grade each, together comprising X% of the total
  These assignments are required for continuing the in-class work, so are due by the following class (i.e. 1 week)
* A larger project assigned mid-way through the course and due in X, comprising Y% of the total

# Out-of-class work expectations
The homework assignments are expected to take 1-2 hours in the weeks they are assigned.

Furthermore, at least 1 hour a week of independent work (reading, self-set assignments, etc.) - see https://github.com/ds4geo/ds4geo/blob/master/Recommended%20Reading. While the course is designed for students without programming experience, additional python programming practice between classes is **highly** recommended.
