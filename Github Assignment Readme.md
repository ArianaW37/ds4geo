# Submitting assignments using github
In this course, in addition to the lecture notes being hosted on github, all assignments will be submitted via a github repository.

For the weekly assignments, a shared private github repository will be used: https://github.com/ds4geo/ds4geo_ws2020
You will have been invited to this repository by email.
As this repository is shared, you will be able to see assignment submissions by other students. This is intentional for two reasons:
1. We will discuss submitted assignments in class.
2. You are encouraged to share and look at each other's code as a way of learning, just as you are encouraged to use google and stackoverflow for help, code snippets and inspiration. However, you should indicate by comments any code or ideas you have coppied from classmates. Github saves the complete "commit" history, so it is easy to see and prove who is copying without acknowledgement.
Note: you also technically can edit other student's assignments, but any edits are recorded and tagged to a user. Later in the course we will cover collaborate code development.

For the main project, you should set up your own github repository which will itself be the submission. Details will be provided later.


# How to submit assignments
## Creating files (not notebooks!) directly in GitHub
You can create text files directly in GitHub as follows:
![test](/res/Create file.png)

Files with a .md extension are "markdown" files. Markdown is a simple text formatting system which is also used for text cells in Jupyter Notebooks. For more information see here:

*Explain how to make a .md file from scratch, then update it online with commits*

*Explain how to create new notebook on colab, and then save it to the private assignments repo.*
