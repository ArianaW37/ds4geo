# Submitting assignments using github
In this course, in addition to the lecture notes being hosted on github, all assignments will be submitted via a github repository.

For the weekly assignments, a shared private github repository will be used: https://github.com/ds4geo/ds4geo_ws2020
You will have been invited to this repository by email.
As this repository is shared, you will be able to see assignment submissions by other students. This is intentional for two reasons:
1. We will discuss submitted assignments in class anyway.
2. You are encouraged to share and look at each other's code as a way of learning, just as you are encouraged to use google and stackoverflow for help, code snippets and inspiration.

For the main project, you should set up your own github repository which will itself be the submission. Details will be provided later.
