Week 1:
Simple data loading and plotting
Simple introduction to a few key python concepts
Matplotlib object based plotting api
Examples: plotting climate proxy time series

Week 2:
Basic data handling
Indexing
Numpy & np indexing
data operations and manipulation
basic statistics/aggregation
Excercises: TBD meteo or hydrology dataset (modern)
LA-ICPMS data reduction (https://www.researchgate.net/publication/328844240_LAtools_A_data_analysis_package_for_the_reproducible_reduction_of_LA-ICPMS_data)

Week 3:
Time series
Interpolating, resampling, smoothing/filtering, etc.
python flow controls and scipy
Excercises:
Spannagel (complex data loading, resampling/interpolating)
Multiple climate proxy records (NGRIP, Antarctic, ocean? speleothem? - Ask Christoph/Gina)


Week 4:
Data comparisons, regressions, curve fitting, etc.
Excercises:
Data from week before which is now prepared


Week 5:
Data viz deep dive
mainly matplotlib
Example of using 3rd party library for e.g. ternary plot
Find appropriate data for matplotlib: image, histogram, bar (complex, e.g. stacked), scatter, other things here: https://matplotlib.org/3.3.0/tutorials/introductory/sample_plots.html
Extended interactive session with student's byo data?

Week 6
???

Week 7:
Unsupervised ML
PCA for data reduction
Clustering
https://www.kaggle.com/kashnitsky/topic-7-unsupervised-learning-pca-and-clustering
Baumkirchen XRF? Or ask Strasser's group?

Introduce main project in week 7 or 8

Week 8:
Supervised ML

Data set(s)???


Week 9:
Neural Networks - theory only.
So people have a general overview of deep learning field
Prac is workshops to support the main project


Week 10:
Scientific Computing standards
Open data, coding standards, commenting, Open code policies, GIT
Prac is short git tutorial - how to do this?
Prac also to support main project
